Imran's music career began in early 90's, in Pakistan and then in the Philippines, and now as a natural transition after years of helping others achieve their dreams and tell their stories, he's back to tell The Story of God. For him, music is not only a therapeutic outlet for expressing that which touches him at the deepest level, but it also represents a medium with no boundaries or limitations. Unlike his broadcast and television work which require a crew and equipment, there is nothing to stop Imran from picking up his guitar and exercising his gift, anytime, anyplace. 

His latest and most significant entrepreneurial endeavor is the birth of The House The Old. That is his name for the sound that represents to Imran the sole place on Earth where all is safe and sacred until The Day of the Standing. 

The First House of God, Al Bait Al Atiq in Arabic and in English, The House The old, built by Abraham and located in Jerusalem. It mirrors what he hopes to inspire with his music; a celebration of the collective good, a One God - as He continues to remind us to ultimately prepare for our bound destiny.
